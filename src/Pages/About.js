            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>🎓 I recently graduated from Bradley University with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science, and a Bachelor of Arts in French.</p>
            <p>👩‍💻🕶🎨 I would love to pursue a career in Software Engineering/Full Stack Development because I see it as a very unique field of work where I can apply both my logic and creativity in equal parts.</p>
            <p>🌐 Before coming to the United States to study, I spent the former part of my life in Dubai, U.A.E where I grew up in a very multicultural community. And so I believe that my upbringing and life experiences so far would bring a unique form of diverse insight to any project or corporation.</p>
            <p>📚✍ Other than that, in my free time, I also enjoy learning different languages and about the cultures that they originate from.</p>
